This repo is currently mostly a placeholder for a new version and a partial rewrite of the
Piglet RDF toolkit and the OINK data browser. The code will be based on the original
source code open-sourced by Nokia under the BSD license (back in 2009, as part of the
Smart-M3 system).

Piglet is a SQLite3-backed simple RDF triple store and an RDF reasoner (actually the
reasoner supports an extended semantics of RDF dubbed "RDF++"). OINK is a generic browser
for RDF data with a plugin-architecture for customization.
